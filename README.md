> A Vue.js chore and job tracker. Claim jobs, confirm your friends jobs, and collect points.

Built to improve my JS skills and learn to use Vue.js.

This is an in-progress Vue.js replacement of [chore tracker](https://github.com/phildenhoff/choretracker), which has *significantly* more functionality as of now, but lacks that... pizazz. If you're looking for tangled code from my first year of CSC, start there. If you're looking for better designed software and interace, check this out.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

```
